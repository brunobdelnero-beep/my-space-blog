                    When Lucas von Hollen first told us that App Inventor sucks, I really didn't believe him. Turns out, he wasn't joking. I first tried creating an app using the App Inventor, but given how terrible the platform is, I decided to build my app using Cursor instead and host it using Expo Go. For this project, I built an app called Siblings or Dating, a game where the user sees an image of a man and a woman, and must guess if they are siblings or a couple.

                    Given that Apple products make it so that it is terribly annoying to deploy any app, I decided to host my platform in an emulator called Expo Go where I was able to do it for free. The process of building the platform itself was pretty straightforward, keeping the design and features fairly simple for now. The main goal for this project was to make something simple that works well. I added a library of two images for now and as the project evolves, I intend on adding features like having a leaderboard of the users that played the game, tracking accuracy per image, and building the library of pictures so that users can engage with the platform for longer. Please see below a few pictures of the app as it stands, keeping in mind this is still WIP.
