                    For the sake of the actual requirements of this assignment, being 1. Something about me, and 2. Include an image, I believe just my LinkedIn profile should suffice, so here you go: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brunobdelnero/" target="_blank">link</a>

                    But now with that out of the way, given that as per our class discussion during syllabus week, the way to get an A in this class is by going ooooooone step further, so here we are...

                    A little more about me if you care to know: I am originally from São Paulo, Brazil, where I was born and raised, but moved to central Florida 9 years ago just as I was about to go into 7th grade. I am at FSU, like most people, because UF rejected me (and not because of the "atmosphere"). Since getting to FSU I have always been very intentional about using college as a means to an end and enjoy it after I have my ticket out – and that's what I did. I recruited the entirety of my freshman and sophomore year for a career in Investment Banking and it ended up working out, so now I can be a bum and spend my time doing random trips over the weekends, play FIFA with the two other bums also in this class (Fernando and Gabe), and vibe code (despite the recent hate from Lucas von Hollen). Post grad I will be moving to NYC with the aforementioned bum, Fernando, and we will have officially escaped FSU and everything that is wrong with it!

                    Now if you got this far you must be veeeeeeeery bored, so here are a few recs of things to do other than reading this blog: 1. Go on a walk. 2. Stare at the wall. 3. Watch paint dry. 4. Watch Silicon Valley. 5. Literally anything else. Thank me later!
